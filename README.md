# Caduceus 

## The Inspiration Behind "Caduceus"

In the annals of mythology, the Caduceus – the staff carried by Hermes, the messenger god – stands as a symbol of divine connection, a conduit between the celestial and the mortal. This revered emblem, with its serpentine twins coiling around a winged rod, has echoed through ages as a symbol of wisdom, communication, and the transfer of knowledge.
Drawing a parallel to this ancient icon, the Caduceus project emerges as our modern-day digital herald. Just as Hermes wielded his staff to bridge worlds, the Caduceus software wields the humble thumbstick – a ubiquitous and simple 'stick' in its own right – transforming it into a vessel of profound knowledge and interaction. This thumbstick, an everyday object, becomes our modern caduceus: a channel through which the vast realms of AI are made accessible, tangible, and personal.

Caduceus revolutionizes the way we interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) by offering a reliable and portable solution that operates offline. It's tailored for Windows users who prioritize data privacy and seek convenience in AI interactions. Its core feature is the integration of LLMs into a USB drive.

## Key Benefits

- **Portability:** Operates directly from a USB drive, offering mobility and flexibility.
- **Windows Compatibility:** Specifically designed for Windows systems, ensuring smooth operation.
- **Offline Accessibility:** Allows users to interact with LLMs without needing an internet connection.
- **Secure Chat History:** Stores all interaction history on the USB drive, ensuring privacy and easy access to previous conversations.
- **User-Friendly Setup:** Simple installation and setup process, accessible even to those with basic computer knowledge.

## Ideal Use Cases

This tool is especially beneficial for professionals who often work in environments with limited or no internet connectivity. Educators, researchers, and business professionals will find it particularly useful for accessing AI-powered insights and assistance on-the-go.

## Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your command prompt or terminal and enter the following command to clone the Caduceus repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Harsh-Avinash/Caduceus.git
   ```

   This command copies the Caduceus project files onto your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Caduceus Directory:**
   Change your directory to the Caduceus folder that was created from the cloning process:

   ```
   cd Caduceus
   ```

3. **Run the Setup Script:**
   To set up Caduceus on your machine, execute the `setup.py` script:

   ```
   python setup.py
   ```

   This script will install necessary dependencies and configure the software for your USB drive.

## What to Expect Next

- **Completion of Setup:** The `setup.py` script will guide you through the process of installing Caduceus on your USB drive.
- **Initial Configuration:** You may be prompted to specify certain preferences or settings during the setup.
- **Downloading LLM Model:** Currently a simple small detfault (quantized) model will be downloaded.

## Post-Installation

After successfully running the setup script, your Caduceus software is ready to use. Simply plug in the USB drive into any Windows machine to start interacting with the LLM offline.

## Design Insights

- **Compact and Efficient:** Designed to maximize the efficiency of LLMs within the constraints of a portable USB drive.
- **Privacy-Focused:** Keeps all data locally on the pendrive, ensuring user privacy and data security.

## Limitations

- **Platform Specificity:** Currently available only for Windows users.
- **Hardware Dependence:** Requires atleast a 16gb pendrive for installation
- **Model Compatibility:** Potential limitations due to the size and compatibility of the LLM with the USB drive hardware.

Caduceus offers a unique blend of portability, privacy, and accessibility, making advanced AI interactions available anywhere, anytime.
